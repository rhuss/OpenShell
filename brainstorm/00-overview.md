## Structure

01 is the parent document defining the overall feasibility study. 02-04 are execution phases:

- **02** depends on: nothing (first step)
- **03** depends on: 02 (cluster must be running)
- **04** depends on: 03 (measurements must be complete)

05 is a standalone bug fix discovered during the warm pool feasibility study.

## Open Threads

- Does the Red Hat Agent Sandbox operator tech preview include extension CRDs? (from #01, #02)
- Does env var injection at claim time trigger cold start? (from #01, #03)
- Is KEP-753 (native sidecars) available on the target OpenShift version? (from #01, #02)
- How does pool exhaustion behave (cold fallback vs. Pending)? (from #03)
- Should findings be posted to upstream agent-sandbox repo? (from #04)
- Should the defensive skip use `debug!` or `warn!` level? (from #05)

## Parked Ideas

None.
